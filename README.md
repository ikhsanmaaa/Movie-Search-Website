# Movie Search Website 

A simple movie search website that allows users to look up movie information using the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/).

## Features

-  **Live Search**: Users can search for movies by typing into the search bar. The search is automatically triggered and connected to the API using AJAX.
-  **jQuery Integration**: This project utilizes jQuery for easier DOM manipulation and AJAX requests.
-  **Dynamic Content**: The movie results fetched from the API are looped through and dynamically displayed as cards on the website.

## API

This project uses the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to fetch movie data.

- **Usage Limit**: The free tier of the OMDb API allows up to **1000 requests per day**.
- You must register to get your own **API key** to use this project.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap (optional if you're using it for styling)

## What I Learned

By building this project, I was able to:

- Work with **AJAX** to fetch data from an external API
- Use **jQuery** to simplify JavaScript tasks and handle events
- Loop through API response objects and dynamically render **movie cards**
- Implement a **responsive search feature** that interacts smoothly with a third-party API
